# gstreamer1.0-plugin-multibox-dvbmediasink
This git is based on pli4 git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpli/gst-plugin-dvbmediasink Branch gst-1.0
It adds support for more boxes then only the et stb's.
Boxes which currently should be ok are:
vuplus series, dm8000 and dm800se
alias : christophecvr
stefansat@telenet.be

An example off bb file is added.

This is the one I use in openpli with the modern openembedded-oe-core.

How to use :

For dreambox machines (dm8000 and dm800se) add --with-dreambox to DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG.
For vuplus machines add --with-vuplus .
For dags machines add --with-dags.

Examples configs :

dreambox dm800se : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-dreambox --with-pcm --with-wma --with-wmv --with-dtsdownmix --with-eac3"
dreambox dm8000  : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-dreambox --with-pcm --with-wma --with-wmv --with-dtsdownmix --with-eac3 --with-amr --with-limited-mpeg4v2"
vuplus           : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-vuplus --with-pcm --with-eac3 --with-amr --with-wmv"

Note since 17032015 vuplus added new drivers.
SRCDATE = "20150317"

For all boxes with drivers from that date or above the --with-vuplus option is not required anymore.
Then the dvbmediasink config for vuplus must be.
vuplus           : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-pcm --with-eac3 --with-amr --with-wmv"
